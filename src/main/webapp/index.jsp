<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 6, 2014, 18.00 PM IST - India Today</span>
<p class="newsContent">The Telugu Desam Party has returned to the National Democratic Alliance and arrived at a seat-sharing arrangement with the BJP for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. "Ours is a lucky combination and our alliance will record a landslide victory getting 300 seats and more in the new Lok Sabha," declared the TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu at a media conference in Hyderabad on Sunday.<br>

After a fortnight of wrangling, the TDP and BJP have agreed to the arrangement in which the BJP will contest eight of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 47 of the 119 Assembly seats in Telangana and five of the 25 Lok Sabha and 15 of the 175 Assembly constituencies in the residuary Andhra Pradesh. The TDP will contest the remaining constituencies in both regions as the Lok Satta, which was earlier expected to be part of the seat-sharing with the BJP and TDP, has announced that the party will go it alone.<br>

<p class="newsContent">With all major political parties using the social media to woo voters, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is bolstering its Internet presence by introducing 'Didi Direct' section on its website and getting Indian Institute of Management (IIM) graduates to write blogs for the party to make the most of it.<br>

"Didi Direct, a new section on the party's website, will focus on all new stories and video content related to the campaign by chairperson Mamata Banerjee and highlight Didi's campaign activities through the ongoing poll season," party Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien told reporters in Kolkata.<br>

<p class="newsContent">Narendra Modi today attacked Sonia Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav accusing them of indulging in vote bank politics and "misleading" Muslims in the name of secularism.<br>
He also sought to blame Gandhi and Yadav for the communal clashes, saying "700 riots took place right under the nose of Madam Soniaji in the last one year and 250 of them took place right here under Netaji (Yadav) in Uttar Pradesh."<br>

<h2 class="newsTitle">Karunanidhi says this may be his last poll, calls Modi irrelavant</h2>
<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 6, 2014, 12.53 AM IST - Times of India</span>
<p class="newsContent">In his first election rally of the season outside Chennai, former chief Minister and DMK supremo M Karunanidhi decided to touch an emotional chord with the voters here as he proclaimed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election could be his final poll outing. Addressing a public meeting at VOC ground on late Saturday evening, the veteran of many electoral battles quickly added that he could go on for another 50 years if DMK's political relevance is reinstated in the state.<br> 

Unlike AIADMK supremo who has refused to mention BJP or its prime minister nominee Narendra Modi in her campaign rallies, the DMK chief came down heavily on both BJP and Modi. People of Tamil Nadu should make leaders like Modi realize that they have no relevance in the state, he said. "Tamil Nadu as of now looks like a no man's political land where anyone could come and establish their clout. They should be taught a lesson. We should resist them like we did during the anti-Hindi struggle in the past," Karunanidhi, 89, told a large gathering of nearly 50,000 people.<br>

<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 5, 2014, 12.32 PM IST - India Today</span>
<p class="newsContent">As the general polls draw near, the BJP is going on an overdrive to secure its vote bank in the Capital. On Friday, party patriarch LK Advani championed the candidature of Harsh Vardhan who has been fielded from the Chandni Chowk constituency.<br>

The party leaders pulled out all the stops to woo the Muslim voters in the constituency, who had reportedly denied support to Vardhan and subsequently the party's PM nominee Narendra Modi, fearing marginalisation.<br>

Vardhan vociferously asked Muslim voters in the constituency to vote sensibly in the upcoming polls.<br>

"You have voted for Kapil Sibal in the past, assuming that he will work for the welfare of the Muslim community. But did he even show his face in the constituency after he was elected? What work did he do for the community's welfare?" he asked.<br>
