<span class="newsTimeStamp">Lucknow Apr 9, 2014, 18.45 PM IST - India Today</span>
<p class="newsContent">Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has come out in support of Azam Khan, who is in a fix after a controversial comment on the role of Muslims in the Kargil conflict. Referring to martyr Abdul Hameed, he said it was true that he won a Param Vir Chakra.<br>

"What's wrong in Azam Khan saying Muslims helped us win Kargil. Isn't it true that he (Abdul Hameed) won a Param Vir Chakra. If I say Yogendra Yadav got a Param Vir Chakra you will say I'm favoring people," he said.<br>

<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 9, 2014, 3.00 PM IST - Times of India</span>
<p class="newsContent">The Aam Aadmi Party has landed in yet another embarrassing situation. Apprehending that party's Lucknow candidate Jaaved Jaaferi's nomination might be rejected because of 'some anomalies' in his voter registration, the AAP also made Adarsh Shastri file his nomination as a "covering candidate". Both filed their papers on the last day for nominations on Wednesday.<br>

Jaaferi, who lives in Mumbai, sources said, had last voted in 2008. Thereafter, his name got deleted from the voters' list and he was not registered as a voter anywhere in India. When party decided to field him from Lucknow, Jaaferi applied online to get himself listed as a voter in Lucknow at the eleventh hour. The last date for voter registration was March 30. His name was included in the voters' list on April 7.<br>

<p class="newsContent">Putting the development agenda in the forefront of his electoral campaign, Bharatiya Janata Party's Prime Minister nominee on Wednesday invoked the legendary Vadodara ruler Sayajirao Gaekwad who he lauded as an epitome of good governance and modernisation while filing his nomination for the Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency.<br>
  
Accompanied by his ministerial colleagues Anandiben Patel, Saurabh Patel and Nitin Patel and State BJP president RC Faldu in a jeep, the Gujarat Chief Minister reached the Vadodra collector's office in a massive procession, straight from a roadshow he held in the city earlier.<br>

<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 9, 2014, 9.46 AM IST - India Today</span>
<p class="newsContent">With only one day left for the Battle of Delhi, India's ruling party seems to have given up, the party that recently ruled Delhi for 49 days seems to have slipped, and the party that got the largest number of seats in the December 2013 Assembly elections seems headed for victory. The lotus is set to bloom amid Delhi's tectonic shift from bipolar to triangular contests.<br>

Thursday will be a very big day for AAP. Delhi's triangular fights could well decide the future of the party in national politics. AAP, despite its strong showing in the Assembly polls, is in troubled waters after its 49-day debacle in Delhi. Recent opinion polls have shown the Congress recapturing a substantial part of the voteshare it lost in the Assembly elections to the Kejriwal-led outfit. A poor AAP show could send the new party relentlessly downhill. Anything less than three seats will be bad news indeed for AAP.<br>

<p class="newsContent">The Telugu Desam Party has returned to the National Democratic Alliance and arrived at a seat-sharing arrangement with the BJP for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. "Ours is a lucky combination and our alliance will record a landslide victory getting 300 seats and more in the new Lok Sabha," declared the TDP chief N. Chandrababu Naidu at a media conference in Hyderabad on Sunday.<br>

After a fortnight of wrangling, the TDP and BJP have agreed to the arrangement in which the BJP will contest eight of the 17 Lok Sabha seats and 47 of the 119 Assembly seats in Telangana and five of the 25 Lok Sabha and 15 of the 175 Assembly constituencies in the residuary Andhra Pradesh. The TDP will contest the remaining constituencies in both regions as the Lok Satta, which was earlier expected to be part of the seat-sharing with the BJP and TDP, has announced that the party will go it alone.<br>

<h2 class="newsTitle">Karunanidhi says this may be his last poll, calls Modi irrelavant</h2>
<span class="newsTimeStamp">Apr 6, 2014, 12.53 AM IST - Times of India</span>
<p class="newsContent">In his first election rally of the season outside Chennai, former chief Minister and DMK supremo M Karunanidhi decided to touch an emotional chord with the voters here as he proclaimed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election could be his final poll outing. Addressing a public meeting at VOC ground on late Saturday evening, the veteran of many electoral battles quickly added that he could go on for another 50 years if DMK's political relevance is reinstated in the state.<br> 

Unlike AIADMK supremo who has refused to mention BJP or its prime minister nominee Narendra Modi in her campaign rallies, the DMK chief came down heavily on both BJP and Modi. People of Tamil Nadu should make leaders like Modi realize that they have no relevance in the state, he said. "Tamil Nadu as of now looks like a no man's political land where anyone could come and establish their clout. They should be taught a lesson. We should resist them like we did during the anti-Hindi struggle in the past," Karunanidhi, 89, told a large gathering of nearly 50,000 people.<br>

<p class="newsContent">As the general polls draw near, the BJP is going on an overdrive to secure its vote bank in the Capital. On Friday, party patriarch LK Advani championed the candidature of Harsh Vardhan who has been fielded from the Chandni Chowk constituency.<br>

The party leaders pulled out all the stops to woo the Muslim voters in the constituency, who had reportedly denied support to Vardhan and subsequently the party's PM nominee Narendra Modi, fearing marginalisation.<br>

Vardhan vociferously asked Muslim voters in the constituency to vote sensibly in the upcoming polls.<br>

"You have voted for Kapil Sibal in the past, assuming that he will work for the welfare of the Muslim community. But did he even show his face in the constituency after he was elected? What work did he do for the community's welfare?" he asked.<br>
